Aikuma is a free Android App for recording and translating spoken language.
Make your own recordings, share them, and translate recordings into other languages.

A special feature of Aikuma is its voice-driven translation mode.
Hold the phone to your ear and listen, and _interrupt_ to give a commentary or translation.
The phone records what you say and lines it up with the original.
Now the meaning is also preserved.

Aikuma means "meeting" in [Usarufa](http://www.ethnologue.com/language/usa), a language of Papua New Guinea where this technology was first tested.
