Aikuma allows users to produce oral commentaries and translations on a source recording.
Each of these is stored as a separate audio file, aligned back to the source.
We are developing a web-based transcription tool.

Users can connect the phone to a computer, load a source recording, identify the phrases and sentences, and enter a time-aligned transcript.
Users can listen to any of the oral commentaries and translations during this process, by clicking on the corresponding spans beneath the waveform.

In preliminary studies, we have found that this leads to higher quality transcriptions and translations.
