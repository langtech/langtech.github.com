## Installation Instructions

There are three approaches to installing Aikuma:

1.
    The simplest is to install it
    on an android phone via
    [Google Play](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lp20.aikuma).

2.
  The second approach involves building Aikuma. In order to build Aikuma the
  Android SDK is required. For information on how to set up the Android SDK, visit
  [http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html](http://developer.android.com/sdk/index.html).
  With the Android SDK set up and an Android phone connected to the computer, run:
  
    $ ant clean debug install

3.
  There is a third approach. It also requires the Android SDK to be installed,
  but no building is required.
