## Design Version 3 (for App version 1.0)

This is an annotated wireframing design. A wireframing design shows the looks of an application, and offers a few click-paths through it. It is partly clickable. Refer to the annotations on what can be clicked. Annotations are on the right of each screen.

Many thanks to various linguists at Melbourne University, especially Lauren Gawne, and also Steven Bird, Oliver Adams for the feedback! -- Florian Hanke
