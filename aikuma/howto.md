This guide outlines how to use Aikuma (version 1.0.0-beta.12). The most current version can be
[downloaded](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lp20.aikuma&amphl=en) from the Google Play store.


Main Page 
----------
This is the screen you will see when you first open Aikuma. You can go to the other parts of the application, and see the list of recordings. 

(main screen image to go here when full of texts)

Using the icons along the top of the screen you can nagivate to other features of the application. 
These other screens are explained in seperate sections below:

* The Aikuma logo will always bring you back to this screen when you are in other areas of the application. 
* The red recording button will take you to the recording screen. You will be able to make a recording.
* The question mark will take you out of the application to the Aikuma website.
* The person image will take you to the list of users. You will be able to add a new user
* The gear is the settings screen. Here you can set the default languages and synching mode.

The main space on this screen is filled with the list of recordings that have been made by users of the application. 
As you can see from the list in the image above, this includes an image of the speaker, and the date and duration of the recording. 


Add a User 
----------
<div class="clear">
This is the page that lists all of the users, and where you can add new users. 


![Users](/images/HowTo/Users.png)

</div>
Here you can see that all users are listed with their photograph, name and languages that they speak.

To add a new user click on the large grey button with the user icon at the top of the screen. It will open this menu:

![New User](/images/HowTo/NewUserEmpty.png)

Sherpa is already listed a language because it has been set as a default language, this is done in the Settings screen (discussed below). To add a new user follow these steps:

1. Add the person's name
2. Take a photograph of the person using the mobile phone in the camera. With most phones you will be given the chance to accept the photo, or reject it and try again.  
3. Delete any of the default languages the person does not speak (press the red cross next to the language name)
4. Add any additional languages the person speaks

The information should now look like this:

![New User](/images/HowTo/NewUserFull.png)

5. Press the green tick to accept and add the user to the list.

You will notice that the tick only becomes bright green when information is added to each field (name, image, languages). You will not be able to accept the user until all information has been added. This person is now added to our list of users.

To go back to the Main screen at any time press the Aikuma logo in the top left-hand corner of the screen.

###Setting A User's Language###
You can attribute as many languages to each individual as necessary. You can either select languages from the list of ISO 639-3 languages or add a language that does not appear in that list. 

If you press the "Add ISO 639-3 Language" button you will be taken into the full list of languages. This is very long, so use the search box at the top of the screen to find the language you want to select. Click on it and it will be added to the speaker's languages. Do this again for each language you want to add.

You can also set a custom language if the language you speak does not exist in the ISO 639-3 list. For example there is no distinction in the codes for Traditional Tiwi or Modern Tiwi (Australia), so speakers of Modern Tiwi might add it as a custom language.

Afer a custom language it has been added it will appear in the list for that speaker.  

To remove a langauge from the list press the red cross next to the language name and it will be removed. 

To go back to the Main screen at any time press the Aikuma logo in the top left-hand corner of the screen.

To go back to the Main screen at any time press the Aikuma logo in the top left-hand corner of the screen.

![Settings page](/images/HowTo/SettingsPage.png)  

###Setting default languages###
You are able to set any number of defaul languages that are listed when you create a new user. This is useful if you are working in a community where the majority of people will all have at least one common language. 

To add a new defaul language, press the "Add Language" button. This will bring up a list many languages (all languages with an ISO 639-3 code), so use the search box at the top of the page to narrow down the options.

![Selecting a Default Language](/images/HowTo/SettingsPageAddingLang.png)


One you have selected a language it will appear in the list of default langauges. 

![Settings page with a default language added](/images/HowTo/SettingsPageLangAdded.png)  


You may select as many languages as defaults as you like. 

You can remove a default language from the list by pressing the red cross next to the language name.

If you remove a language from the list of default languages it will not change the languages listed for participants you created earlier.

###Syncing the device to a server###
This part of the settings page is only relevant if you are using Aikuma as part of a network of devices. 
If you have created a central server for the network you can type in the IP address and information. 
'Automatic Sync' can be turned on or off by pressing the button. Pressing 'Sync now' will sync the data on this device with the server only if the correct information has been typed above and there is an available connection.

To go back to the Main screen at any time press the Aikuma logo in the top left-hand corner of the screen.
