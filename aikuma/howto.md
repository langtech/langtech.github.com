Using Aikuma 
============ 
This guide outlines how to use Aikuma (version 1.0.0-beta.12). The most current version can be
[downloaded](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=org.lp20.aikuma&amphl=en) from the Google Play store.


Main Page 
----------
This is the page that lists all the recordings that have been made. It is also the page you can use to navigate to other features of the app.


Add a User 
----------
On this page you can add different users. 

###User's Language###
You can also set a custom language as a default if the language you are working with does not exist in the ISO 639-3 list. For example there is no distinction in the codes for Traditional Tiwi or Modern Tiwi (Australia), so speakers of Modern Tiwi might add it as a custom language. 

![Add a custom language]

Afer a custom language it has been added it will appear in the list with any other default languages you have set.  

![Settings page with a custom language added]

To remove a langauge from the default languages list press the red cross next to the language name and it will be taken out of the list. 



Record 
----------
This is where you can record stories 


Settings 
---------- 
The settings page allows you to set the default languages. It also has setting for synchronising devices after they have been used. Below is a screenshot of the settings page.

###Setting default languages###
You are able to set any number of defaul languages that are listed when you create a new user. This is useful if you are working in a community where the majority of people will all have at least one common language. 

To add a new defaul language, press the "Add Language" button. This will bring up a list many languages (all languages with an ISO 639-3 code), so use the search box at the top of the page to narrow down the options.


![Selecting a Default Language](/images/HowTo/SettingsPageAddingLang.png)


One you have selected a language it will appear in the list of default langauges. 


![Settings page with a default language added](/images/HowTo/SettingsPageLangAdded.png)


You may select as many languages as defaults as you like. 

You can remove a default language from the list by pressing the red cross next to the language name.

If you remove a language from the list of default languages it will not change the languages listed for participants you created earlier.


###Syncing the device to a server###
This part of the settings page is only relevant if you are using Aikuma as part of a network of devices. 
If you have created a central server for the network you can type in the IP address and information. 
'Automatic Sync' can be turned on or off by pressing the button. Pressing 'Sync now' will sync the data on this device with the server only if the correct information has been typed above and there is an available connection.
