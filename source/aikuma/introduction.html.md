## Mobile 路 Crowdsourced 路 Distributed 路 Natural 路 Language Preservation

A social media based network for crowd sourced language preservation.

The word "Aikuma" means "meeting" in the language with which this project has first been tested: [Usarufa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usarufa_language) \[[usa](http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=usa)\].

## Introduction

Most of the world's languages are in danger of disappearing.  As people shift to using major world languages, the words and stories of ancestral languages are being lost.  Linguists are working hard to document and describe the world's languages, but there aren't enough linguists to do the work.  The only way it will happen is if the speakers of the languages get involved.

Fortunately, digital recording technology is cheap, and people can be trained to record their languages.  But in addition to the primary recordings we need some annotations: _metadata_ for identifying the language and documenting permissions, _respeaking_ to provide a clean audio source that is easier for a linguist transcribe phonetically, and _oral translation_ so we know the meaning of the text even once no speakers remain.
