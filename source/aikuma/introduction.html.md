## Crowdsourcing Oral Language Documentation using Mobile Devices

Aikuma is a free Android App designed for recording and translating oral literature.
Listen to stories, dialogues and songs, all sorted by language and location.
Make your own recordings and instantly share them with other Aikuma users over the Web.

A special feature of Aikuma is its voice-driven translation mode.
Hold the phone to your ear and listen, and _interrupt_ to give a commentary or translation.
The phone records what you say and lines it up with the original.
Now the meaning is also preserved.

The resulting database of recordings aligned with translations will be an audio "Rosetta Stone".
It will be housed in the [Language Commons](http://archive.org/details/LanguageCommons) a multimedia collection that is part of the Internet Archive, the most credible digital archive on the planet.
In the future, it should be possible to use this data to decipher newly discovered recordings from long-forgotten languages.

## Origin of the name "Aikuma"

Aikuma means "meeting" in the [Usarufa](http://www.ethnologue.com/language/usa) language of New Guinea, where this technology was first tested.
