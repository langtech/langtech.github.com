## Mobile 路 Crowdsourced 路 Distributed 路 Natural 路 Language Preservation

A social media based network application for crowd sourced language preservation.

The word "Aikuma" means "meeting" in the language with which this project has first been tested: [Usarufa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usarufa_language) \[[usa](http://www.ethnologue.com/show_language.asp?code=usa)\].

## Introduction

Digital recording technology is cheap, and people can be trained to record their languages.  But in addition to the primary recordings we need some annotations: _metadata_ for identifying the language and documenting permissions, _respeaking_ to provide a clean audio source that is easier for a linguist transcribe phonetically, and _oral translation_ so we know the meaning of the text even once no speakers remain.

Aikuma aims to do these steps as automatically and simply as possible such that *everybody*  can participate.
