## About

The word "Aikuma" means "meeting" in the language [Usarufa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usarufa_language) (ethnologue code "usa"), the language with which this project has first been tested.

Most of the world's languages are in danger of disappearing.  As people shift to using major world languages, the words and stories of ancestral languages are being lost.  Linguists are working hard to document and describe the world's languages, but there aren't enough linguists to do the work.  The only way it will happen is if the speakers of the languages get involved.

Fortunately, digital recording technology is cheap, and people can be trained to record their languages.  But in addition to the primary recordings we need some annotations: _metadata_ for identifying the language and documenting permissions, _respeaking_ to provide a clean audio source that is easier for a linguist transcribe phonetically, and _oral translation_ so we know the meaning of the text even once no speakers remain.

## Pilot Project

![BOLD:PNG Collage](/images/bold-collage.jpg)

A [pilot project](/bold-png/) has used digital voice recorders for large scale audio collection work, and demonstrated a ground-swell of support for using technology for language preservation.

In this new project, we will explore ways to use smart phones and 3G networks to enable preservation and access for endangered language data.  The collected materials will be preserved in the _Language Commons_, an open collection of linguistic resources hosted in the Internet Archive.

This approach is novel in being purely oral.  It sidesteps the problems that arise for languages which are not written, and makes it possible to work with people who are not literate in their mother tongue.  It also makes it possible to work quickly, and to capture the most natural and authentic forms of linguistic expression.  Importantly, it gives a voice to marginalized people, and fosters pride in their cultural identity.

More generally, a large audience is interested in safeguarding heritage recordings and making them interpretable by others.  A recording of a grandparent can be digitized and annotated in the same way, in order to ensure long-term preservation and access.

We are in the process of developing an Android prototype application. We have completed a first field test in Papua New Guinea in February 2012, see below. 

In its current state, the app will have some shortcomings, but show the direction that we are planning to go. We will be uploading newer versions as they become available.

## Process

We visited the village of Imikori, in the [Usarufa](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Usarufa_language) language area, from 15-18 February 2012.  We trained 10 people to use the Android phones for recording and sharing stories.

### Storytelling

![Storytelling](/images/report-png/storytelling.png)

On our first day in the village, we organised a large mumu (ground oven) and fed about 60 people of all ages. Then we set up a bench and invited people to tell stories to the assembled crowd. We asked that the children not be sent away, as had been suggested. There was no shortage of storytellers, and their stories were well received, sometimes with minor corrections from the audience.

We used this setting to communicate key aspects of our work: documenting traditional knowledge of the kind that can be shared publicly, demonstrating interest in the local language in front of a younger generation that has stopped learning it, and making continual use of recording devices.

On this occasion we were formally welcomed to the village, and elders spoke about the importance of recording their language for the benefit of future generations.

### User Registration

![User Registration](/images/report-png/capturing.png)

Each participant signed on to the system, speaking their name, typing it, and permitting their photo to be taken. User identities were automatically propagated to all the phones, so that any individual could use any phone for recording their speech.

We explained this process in English to one person.  Then he explained it in Usarufa to the others.  Participants helped each other to identify the location of the microphone, to use the touchscreen keyboard, and to take a photograph. We were surprised how quickly people were able to use the touchscreens, even though they had not experienced this technology before. 

### Recording

![Recording](/images/report-png/recording.png)

Once registered, individuals went off on their own and started to record stories.  (Given that the software prototype is at an early stage, we had not disabled the touchscreen during recording, and so people could not hold the phone to their face in the usual way. This did not seem to compromise the naturalness of the recording activity.)

### Recording Others

![Tutoring](/images/report-png/tutoring.png)

In some cases, it was easiest if one person held the phone to record another.  This woman told the story of her life, and used discourse styles that were not apparent in the speech of younger people.

### Listening

![Listening](/images/report-png/listening.png)

The content of each phone was automatically shared with the other phones, enabling people to listen to each other's stories. An experimental +1 feature enabled people to indicate whether they liked a story. Stories were ranked by popularity and recency.

### Adding Oral Annotations

![Play](/images/report-png/respeak-play.png)

We tested two mobile versions for [respeaking, or oral annotation](http://www.boldpng.info/bold/stage2).  This involves two activities, _careful respeaking_, in which the original phrase is repeated carefully and slowly, and _oral translation_, in which the original phrase is translated into English.

In the approach pictured here, the user must press and hold the play button to hear a recorded original, then release it to stop playback.
When ready, the user must press and hold the record button to supply an oral annotation.  This is linked to the corresponding part of the original recording, to support later work in producing a written transcription and translation. 

![Record](/images/report-png/respeak-record.png)

A second approach we tested was a speech controlled interface, in which playback and recording was solely controlled by voice. This approach is not pictured, since it is simply a person holding a phone, as one would in a phone call.

For our test subject, both approaches proved to be feasible from a human computer interface standpoint.

## Miscellaneous & Impressions

### Setup

![Setup](/images/report-png/setup.png)

The setup consisted of seven Huawei U8510-1 mobile phones with Android version 2.3.3 and the latest version of our BOLD application prototype. The phones were networked using an ASUS NT-16P wireless router with FTP file storage on a 4GB USB memory stick. This memory stick was used to synchronize recordings and user accounts between phones via wireless.

We used a 70Ah lead-acid battery and 230V inverter to power the router and the phones. The router drew 1A, while the phones drew a total of 3.5A when recharging. The car battery proved enough to power the whole setup for three days (2 major experiments of three hours each) including two full charges of a MacBook Pro.

This configuration was necessary for working off-grid. The software just requires the phones to have (occasional) broadband access for synchronizing data to a central server.
