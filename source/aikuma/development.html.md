## Development

Aikuma development is hosted on GitHub.
Implementation is in Java, for Android 2.3.
The code is available under the [MIT License](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License).

### Current work

We are working on a new prototype, and the interface is set out in a series of [wireframes](./design.html).
We expect to implement this for the Android 4 platform. (This platform is already adopted by 25% of users and phones are available from $150).
