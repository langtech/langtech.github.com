## Open Source

Aikuma is fully [open sourced](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open-source_software) under the [MIT style license](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License). It is a Java based Android application.

* Have a look at the [Code](http://github.com/langtech/aikuma).
* Report [Issues](http://github.com/langtech/aikuma/issues).

### Current work

We are currently working on replacing our prototype, version 1 (for more details see the [pilot project description](./pilot_project.html)) with a [new design](./design.html), version 2. The new design is based on Android and can run on more modern Android 4 phones (currently adopted by 25% of Android users). Phones are available from 150$.

* See the [old design in action](./pilot_project.html) in Papua New Guinea, 2012.
* See the [new design](./design.html) to be used in the next field study in Papua New Guinea.
